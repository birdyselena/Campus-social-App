2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API to get your project URL and anon key
3. Update `src/services/supabase.js` with your credentials:

```javascript
const supabaseUrl = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL";
const supabaseAnonKey = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY";
```

### Step 3: Set up Database

1. In your Supabase project, go to the SQL editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database/schema.sql`
3. Run the SQL commands to create all tables and policies

### Step 4: Configure Authentication

## Testing the App

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. ‚úÖ Register a new student account
2. ‚úÖ Login with existing credentials
3. ‚úÖ Navigate through all main tabs
4. ‚úÖ View and interact with UI components
5. ‚è≥ Create and join chat groups (UI ready)
6. ‚è≥ Create and attend events (UI ready)
7. ‚è≥ View coins balance and transactions (UI ready)
8. ‚úÖ Update profile information
9. ‚úÖ Sign out and back in

### Known Issues
